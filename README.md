Hi! I'm a Computer Engineering student in Spain at University Pompeu Fabra hoping to fulfill my dream of working in cybersecurity area. My hobbies are all kind fo sports, playing video games and learning throughout my life.
I'm a beginner as I'm actually learning Python at UPF but I have some experience with JavaScript, HTML, Arduino, Processing, CSS (Not so difficult programming languages)
Nowadays, my high goal is to learn hacking and have an ethical hacking job
